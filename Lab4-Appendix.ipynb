    "\n",
    "To understand how one can compute the length of the recurring cycle of $1/d$ we have to look at the division algorithm in more detail. Let us take the case of $1/7$. The first part of the algorithm multiplies the numerator by $10$ until it becomes larger than the denominator. In our case we multiply $1\\cdot 10$ (if we had $d>10$ we would multiply by 100, and if we had $d>100$ we would multiply by $1000$).\n",

    "Now the division algorithm proceeds as follows\n",
    "- First $10/7$ is $1$ with a remainder of $3$,\n",
    "- Then $10 \\cdot 3 / 7$ is $4$ with a remainder of $2$, \n",
    "- Then $10 \\cdot 2 / 7$ is $2$ with a remainder of $6$, \n",
    "- Then $10 \\cdot 6 / 7$ is $8$ with a remainder of $4$,\n",
    "- Then $10 \\cdot 4 / 7$ is $5$ with a remainder of $5$,\n",
    "- Then $10 \\cdot 5 / 7$ is $7$ with a remainder of $1$, \n",
    "- And $10 \\cdot 1 / 7$ is $1$ with a remainder of $3$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is clear that this process would repeat, and that the length of this cycle is $6$. The important observation here is that if $r_1$ is the first remainder, in the next step we are doing $r_2 = (10\\cdot r_1) \\% 7$ to get the second remainder, and so on, $r_n = (10\\cdot r_{n-1}) \\% 7$. The sequence $r_1,r_2,\\ldots$ has to have a cycle because its entries are numbers between $0$ and $6$ (because we are taking reminders mod $7$). \n"
