    "\n",
    "Sample framework classes are provided below, together with 3 dummy stubs so that you can test your contribution. The idea is for you edit **one** of the stubs, which you can then upload as your contribution. To test that your edited stub works, you will have to fix the the class A1 here so that is calls your class `A1_/username/` instead of the place-holder class `A1_ac1234`, but you do not upload the modified A1 class. You use it here to test your code, but is not part of your contribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Candidate class does not need to be modified to test your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, the OfficialCandidate class will work as is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these classes are identical to the framework classes on GitHub, where they cannot be modified, and to the classes that will be used to compile your code this weekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "A main class A1, which will run the election, is provided below as an example. You will need to modify it here to test your code, but you cannot modify the version on GitHub (which already has the call to your contribution built-in).\n",
    "\n",
    "Your vote() procedure will be used together with everyone else's \n",
    "to cast votes in an election for the Mayor of Tower Hamlets, QM Edition. Vote wisely! \n",
    "\n",
    "The winner will be the most frequent object among the votes cast. \n",
    "In case of a tie, it will be chosen at random among one of the most frequent objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your procedure `winner(Candidat[])` will not be used in the main election, \n",
    "but will be used in some 'higher order' elections: instead of counting votes cast using a simple most-frequent-wins algorithm, your `winner(Candidat[])` procedures will each be called on the array of votes cast. This will produce an array of winners, one for each of your counting procedures. The winner of this higher order election is then the most frequent winner among these. This process can be compounded to produce an even higher order winner-of-winners-of-winners result. We will see if the process converges.\n",
