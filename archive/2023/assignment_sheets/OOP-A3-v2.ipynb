    "The class A3 has no instance members, just a 'main' and some helper procedures, and no A3 objects are ever created.\n",
    "It is possible to create A3 objects, \n",
    "but the type A3 acts as an empty class, equivalent to `class A3 { }`, \n",
    "because all its members are static.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your class `Candidate_/username/` will have both a 'main' allowing the class to be 'run' \n",
