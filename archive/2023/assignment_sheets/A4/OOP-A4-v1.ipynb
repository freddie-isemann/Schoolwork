    "Your room's visit method interacts with the visitor it receives \n",
    "via the [`Visitor`](Visitor.java) interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your code can tell the visitor things by calling its `tell(String)` method; \n",
    "the string you pass will be shown to the user. \n",
    "You should first tell the visitor about the room and the state it is in. \n",
    "This may depend on the direction the visitor arrives from \n",
    "and/or on the state of your room's instance variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your room can ask the visitor to make a choice \n",
    "by calling the visitor's `getChoice(String,char[])` method\n",
    "and then tell the visitor the consequences of that choice.\n",
    "For example, a visitor may be able to \n",
    "blow out or light candles, look inside a cupboard, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like, you can give the visitor an [`Item`](Item.java) object via the giveItem(Item). You can also check if the visitor is carrying a particular item \n",
    "by calling `hasIdenticalItem(Item)` or `hasEqualItem(Item)`. \n",
    "You should not give more than one item per visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you like, depending on the visitor's choices, \n",
    "your room can give pieces of gold to the visitor via the `giveGold` method \n",
    "and/or take pieces via the `takeGold` method. \n",
    "The latter returns the amount of gold actually taken, \n",
    "as sometimes the visitor will simply not have the amount your room tries to take. \n",
    "You should not give or take more than 10 pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "After one or several interactions, \n",
    "your `visit` method should return the direction in which the visitor leaves the room. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your interaction code should be branching (if/else/switch), not looping (for/while): the number of interactions may depend on the choices made but should have a fixed bound. Try to keep visits brief so that the visitor can visit many rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the visitor may return to your room several times. Your room should have some state (lights on or off, trunk emptied or not, poltergeist grumpy or friendly, etc).\n"

    "You must not pass the `getChoice(String,char[])` method an empty string or empty array. \n",

    "    \n",
    "The `getChoice(String,char[])` method will return one of the characters in the array it is passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `takeGold(int)` method will return an integer between zero and the integer it is passed (inclusive).\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods `hasIdenticalItem(Item)` or `hasEqualItem(Item)` will return true iff some room's visit method has called `giveIem(Item)` with an identical or equal item (items being equal iff their names are equal) and true was returned. In other words, once an item is accepted, it cannot be dropped."
