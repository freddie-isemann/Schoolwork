    "The purpose of this lab is to allow you to make use of the basics of Java that you have learned in the first part of the module. We will write a rudimentary implementation of the [M,n,k-game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M,n,k-game). This is a generalization of the usual noughts-and-crosses (or tic-tac-toe) that is played on a grid with `m` rows, `n` columns, and where you need to put `k` X's (or O's) in a row/column/diagonal to win. \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, we are going to write three classes: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Index`, \n",
    "2. `Grid`,\n",
    "3. `Position`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate aim of the lab is to write a method `boolean winFor(Player p)` in the class `Position`, that will, of course, return true if the position is a win for player `p`. \n",

    "Please don't forget to answer the [questionnaire](https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/mod/questionnaire/complete.php?id=2200932) before leaving. \n",

    "We will first write the class `Index`. Open the file [Index.java](Index.java). You will see there that this class has two public instance variables called: `row` and `column`. Basically the way that one speaks about a cell in a grid is by saying for example: \"the cell in row 5 and column 2\". The \"row 5, column 2\" is the **index**. In our case, that particular index would be given by the object `new Index(4,1)`. Remember that arrays in java are indexed from `0` to `n-1` where `n` is the length of the array, that is why it is `new Index(4,1)` and not `new Index(5,2)`. \n",

The array that the method returns must contain all possible indices where the `row` variable is smaller than `m` and the `column` variable is smaller than `n`. Here are a couple of examples: "

If `moves == 0` you simply call the method that you have defined above (note that you want the position to be a win for player `player` but *not a win* for his opponent). If `moves > 0` depending on whose turn it is (which you can gather by looking at how many cells are filled with X and how many with O) you can do the following: if it is `player`'s turn, you ask whether there exists a new position `p2` that has an X or O, depending on who `player` is, in one of the empty cells, such that `p2.winFor(player, moves-1)` is true.  If it is the opponents turn, you ask whether *for all* successive positions `p2`, `p2.winFor(player, moves-1)` returns true. (This means that wherever the opponent plays we can still win). \n",
